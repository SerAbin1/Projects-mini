# Projects Showcase

A repository showcasing my work and progress on various projects from different platforms.

This repo contains solutions and projects that I have built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)’s full-stack web development curriculum. You can explore different subdirectories for each project I have completed.
